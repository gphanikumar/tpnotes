# notebooks

## Sagemath + Jupyter

The following notebooks use [sagemath](https://sagemath.org) kernel. You can download the ipynb file to your computer and open it in the jupyter notebook interface to play with it. Toggle the option "trust" to ensure the notebook is rendered properly.

* Characteristic Polynomial [ipynb](sage-notebooks/CharacteristicPolynomial.ipynb)
* Planar Flows [ipynb](sage-notebooks/PlanarFlows.ipynb)
* Vector Field Plots [ipynb](sage-notebooks/VectorFieldPlots.ipynb)
* Continuity equation in Cylindrical coordinate system [ipynb](sage-notebooks/ContinuityCylindrical.ipynb)
* Continuity equation in Spherical coordinate system [ipynb](sage-notebooks/ContinuitySpherical.ipynb)


## Mathematica 

The following notebooks use [mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica) kernel. If you have a license for mathematica, you can download the nb files and open them. Else, you can download the cdf files and open them in [Wolfram Player for Notebooks](https://www.wolfram.com/player). You can view the pdf files to see what is in there. You may need to download them in raw mode before opening them.

* Simple Planer Flows [nb](mathematica-notebooks/GradFlowPattern.nb) [cdf](mathematica-notebooks/GradFlowPattern.cdf) [pdf](mathematica-notebooks/GradFlowPattern.pdf)

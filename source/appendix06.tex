\section{Change of variable with multiple integrals}
\label{variablechange}

This section is adapated from section 3.16 of \cite{aris}. In cartesian co-ordinates the element of volume $dV$ is the volume of rectangular parallelepiped of sides $dx_1$, $dx_2$ and $dx_3$:

$$ dV =  dx_1 dx_2 dx_3 $$

It is sometimes convenient to describe position by some other co-ordinates, say, $\xi_1$, $\xi_2$ and $\xi_3$ which are fixed to the control volume as it is moving along with the fluid. These coordinates are called as {\it convected} coordinates. These coordinates are such that the initial volume of the fluid element is given by

$$ dV_0 = d\xi_1 \, d\xi_2 \, d\xi_3 $$


The change of co-ordinate system must be given
 by fixing a point $x$ such that 

$$x_i = x_i(\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3) $$

Small differences in the new co-ordinate system are given by 

$$ dx_i = \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial \xi_j} d\xi_j $$

If $dx^{(j)}$ are three vectors with components $(\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial \xi_j} d\xi_j)$ for $j=1,2,3$ then the volume of the element enclosed by these vectors is given by:

$$ dV = dx^{(1)} \cdot ( dx^{(2)} \times dx^{(3)} ) $$

Using $\epsilon_{ijk}$ to write the short form of determinant (triple product),

$$ dV = \epsilon_{ijk} \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial \xi_1} d\xi_1 \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial \xi_2} d\xi_2 \frac{\partial x_k}{\partial \xi_3} d\xi_3  $$


$$ dV = J \, d\xi_1 \, d\xi_2 \, d\xi_3  = J \, dV_0$$

where $J$ is the Jacobian of the transformation of variables.

$$ J = \frac{\partial(x_1, x_2, x_3)}{\partial(\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3)} = \epsilon_{ijk} \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial \xi_1} \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial \xi_2} \frac{\partial x_k}{\partial \xi_3} $$

In determinant form, it is 

\begin{equation}
J = \left|
\begin{array}{lll}
\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial \xi_1} &  \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial \xi_2} & \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial \xi_3} \\
\\
\frac{\partial x_2}{\partial \xi_1} &  \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial \xi_2} & \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial \xi_3} \\
\\
\frac{\partial x_3}{\partial \xi_1} &  \frac{\partial x_3}{\partial \xi_2} & \frac{\partial x_3}{\partial \xi_3}
\end{array}
\right|
\end{equation}

Evidently, when two of the rows are same, the determinant is zero.
